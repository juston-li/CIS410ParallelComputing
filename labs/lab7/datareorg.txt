Only change I made was to array B; swapping the column and rows. 
C stores arrays by Row-major-order so we want the loops to increment 
across the row before moving to the next column as values across the row
are likely to be in cache after the first value is read. Array B did not 
follow this; incrementing columns before rows which would increase the
likelyhood of cache misses. Swap the rows and columns of array B to follow row-major-order
